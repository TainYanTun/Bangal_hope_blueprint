# Bangla Hope Blueprint

**Senior Development Project 1: Orphanage Sponsorship & Student Management System**

This repository contains the initial wireframes, prototypes, and design blueprints for the **Bangla Hope** management system. The project aims to provide a comprehensive digital solution for managing student records, sponsorship details, and program-wide analytics for the Bangla Hope orphanage and its associated educational programs.

Bangla Hope is a sponsorship program that supports children across multiple platforms:
